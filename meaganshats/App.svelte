    <h1>Meagan's Hats!</h1>

    <p>
      Alright y'all, here's what's going on: if you haven't heard, <a
        href="https://www.instagram.com/carakeleher">@carakeleher</a
      >
      and I are planning to hike the PCT in a year and a half, which we're so fricken
      pumped for (check out the saga of our friendship at @meaganandcara on IG).
      In order to start fundraising so we can, like, eat on the trail, I'm making
      and selling some awesome hats!
    </p>

    <p>
      I'm selling them for $25 + shipping (or more if you want to by us you
      know, a couple burgers each or a night at a hostel). <b
        >If you're interested, dm me (<a
          href="https://www.instagram.com/meagangoesoutside"
          >@meagangoesoutside</a
        > on IG) with a preference like "striped", "muted", or "absolutely crazy"
        and I'll pick a hat that matches your chosen vibe.</b
      >
    </p>

    <p>
      Tell you friends! Tell your family! Buy for Christmasor other winter
      holidays!
